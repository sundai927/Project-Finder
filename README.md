How to run this project locally (and still connect to database)
1. [Download Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) and make sure it's PHP 7.3 (this lets you run PHP files on your local computer)
2. Find the xampp folder on your computer (windows should be C:\xampp unless you changed it)
3. Go into the htdocs folder
4. clone the project into that folder
5. Open up the Xampp control panel and click start for Apache
